# Colorify
This is an extension for Chrome browsers which detects css recognized color names being used on websites and then colorizes them appropriately.


## Example
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy rainbow dog.

Black, silver, gray, white, maroon, red, purple, fuchsia, green, lime, olive, yellow, navy, blue, teal, and aqua.


# Docs
Written using Mark.js for search and highlighting functionality, the extension also runs a contrast ratio check to determine if a text-shadow should be applied.
